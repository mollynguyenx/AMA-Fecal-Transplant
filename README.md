## Background:
We were interested in the study conducted by Kang et al. in 2017 on fecal microbiota transplants and their use to treat the behavioral and gastrointestinal symptoms of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) which have previously been linked to abnormal gut microbiomes. The researchers sequenced the microbiomes of the control and treatment groups through metabarcoding to assemble microbiome compositions. We compared the gut microbiome compositions between the treatment (recieved an FMT) and control (did not recieve an FMT) groups.

Overall, a more complex gut microbiome was found in subjects who recieved an FMT (treatment) than those who did not (control). This data is still hard to interpret, as the microbiome composition data before treatment is not shown. Assuming that the gut microbiome compositions of the treatment group before recieving the FMT are similar to those of the control group, it can be assumed that the FMTs were successful in increasing the microbiome's diversity.
