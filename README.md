## Background:
We were interested in the study conducted by Kang et al. in 2017 on fecal microbiota transplants and their use to treat the behavioral and gastrointestinal symptoms of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this study, the researchers aimed to treat some of the GI and behavioral issues seen in children with autism that had previously been linked to abnormalities in the gut microbiome. We compared the gut microbiome compositions between the treatment (recieved an FMT) and control (did not recieve an FMT) groups. 

## Methods: 


## Findings:
